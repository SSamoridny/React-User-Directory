## Description: 

         In this project we use React to build a sortable and searchable employee directory using an outside API 

## Installation:

         This project needs no installation as a working link is provided below

## Usage:

         Upon opening the link the user can take a look at the directory and search the employee name in the search bar or use the arrow icons beside the phone number and name to search and sort through the list of people 

## Credits:

        Fil Labourde-Basto, Daniel Ceballos and various classmates and study groups who helped me to build my skills
